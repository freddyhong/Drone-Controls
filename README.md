# Drone Controls

**Course:** ME-457 Drone Control, The Cooper Union  
**Autors:** Calcifer Kim, Myisha Hassan, Wongee (Freddy) Hong

This repository contains the code and documentation for our semester-long drone control project, developed as part of the ME-457 course at The Cooper Union.

Our project is based on the [`mavsim_public`](https://github.com/byu-magicc/mavsim_public) repository by the BYU MAGICC Lab, which provides a simulation environment for small UAV dynamics and control.

## Overview

This repository includes:

- Modified simulation models
- Custom controller implementations (e.g., PID, LQR)
- Kalman filter integration
- Test plots and performance evaluations
